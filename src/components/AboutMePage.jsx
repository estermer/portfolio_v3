    <h2>Hi, I am Eric Stermer</h2>

    <p>I strive to find solutions that drive incremental change in simple everyday experiences.</p>

    <p>
      My interest in coding began when I was prompted to watch Coding Stars and complete The Hour of
      Code on Khan Academy. From that moment I knew I had found my passion.
    </p>

    <p>I built this site to showcase my growing skills in web development and coding.</p>
